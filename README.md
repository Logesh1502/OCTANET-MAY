This task contains creating a landing page of my own quiz website with the help of HTML,CSS and Javascript.
 Theory of the Web Page

The provided web page appears to be a landing page for a website centered around quizzes related to various sports. The structure and functionality can be analyzed from both a technical and theoretical perspective.

 Purpose and Structure

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this landing page is to engage users with sports-themed quizzes and provide them with information about the platform. It aims to attract users interested in sports trivia, encouraging them to sign up and participate in quizzes.

Structure:
1. Head Section:
    - Metadata includes charset, viewport settings, and compatibility.
    - Links to external resources such as CSS styles (`index.css`), icons, and manifest file.

2. Body Section:
    - Navigation: A top navigation bar with a menu button that opens a side navigation bar for better accessibility on smaller screens.
    - Main Content: 
        - Welcome Section: Includes a greeting and a button linking to an external resource (GeeksforGeeks).
        - Sports Section: Showcases different sports (Cricket, Football, Hockey) with associated images and tooltips.
        - Sign-Up Section: Contains a form for user registration with fields for name, email, and password. It also includes a section with rules and additional information.
    - Footer: Basic footer with a creator credit and pagination for navigation through different sections or pages.
 Technical Implementation

1. HTML:
    - Utilizes semantic HTML to structure content meaningfully (e.g., `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
    - Forms and interactive elements are appropriately marked up with form inputs and buttons.
    - Image tags and anchor links are used to display media and navigate between sections.

2. CSS:
    - External CSS (`index.css`) is linked to style the page, ensuring separation of concerns.
    - Classes and IDs are used for styling specific elements, such as navigation, content boxes, and tooltips.

   3.JavaScript:
    - JavaScript (`index.js`) manages interactive elements, specifically the opening and closing of the side navigation bar.
    - Functions `openNavbar()` and `closeNavbar()` manipulate the width of the side navigation bar to create a responsive design.

Theoretical Perspective

From a theoretical standpoint, the design of this landing page is grounded in several key principles of web development and user experience (UX) design:

1. User Engagement:
    - The use of sports images and quizzes taps into the interests of the target audience, fostering engagement.
    - The welcome message and motivational quote aim to create a positive first impression.

2. Responsive Design:
    - The navigation bar's ability to transform into a side menu on smaller screens is a practical application of responsive design principles, ensuring usability across devices.

3. Usability and Accessibility:
    - Clear navigation options and a straightforward sign-up form improve usability.
    - The use of tooltips provides additional information without cluttering the interface, enhancing the user experience.

4. Content Organization:
    - The logical division of content into sections (Welcome, Sports, Sign-Up) helps users find information quickly and easily.
    - The inclusion of rules and additional information in a scrolling marquee provides necessary details in an engaging format.

Overall, the landing page is designed to be attractive, functional, and user-friendly, with a clear focus on engaging users through sports-themed quizzes and facilitating easy navigation and interaction.
